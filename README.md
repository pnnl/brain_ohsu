# TRAILMAP Modification

This is a modification of the code described in  [Mapping Mesoscale Axonal Projections in the Mouse Brain Using A 3D Convolutional Network](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/812644v1.full) Friedmann D, Pun A, et al and located at [Github TrailMap](https://github.com/AlbertPun/TRAILMAP). The original TrailMap licence is located [here](https://github.com/dfriedma/TRAILMAP/blob/master/LICENSE) and the licence for nnUNet and batchgenerators are [here](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet/blob/master/LICENSE) and [here](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/batchgenerators/blob/master/LICENSE), respectively. The copies of the licences are also included in this repository. Files have been modified.

## Getting Started - Installation

Please follow the detailed instruction on [Github TrailMap](https://github.com/AlbertPun/TRAILMAP) and also pip install batchgenerators

```
pip install batchgenerators==0.25
```

## Inference

Please follow the instructions at [Github TrailMap](https://github.com/AlbertPun/TRAILMAP) with these modifications. The performance metrics are only run on the first tif file witin a folder.
* Add model weights path to segment_brain_batch.py at the model_weight_list variable.
* Add the path to the data (with label and volume folders) for the image_path variable. This path can include an suffix variable. This script will use labels to calculate performance metrics for inference.
* The boolean argument indicates if you want to use gaussian inference
* The string argument indicates training/validation/test data division suffix (leave '' if not using suffix)
* Use the combination number of the desired model_weight and image_path combination as an argument for segment_brain_batch.py.
* Change Validation_Data to False if using the whole dataset, not just the last 1/4


```
python3 segment_brain_batch.py True "_test_1" {combination_number}

```

## Training

Please follow the instructions at [Github TrailMap](https://github.com/AlbertPun/TRAILMAP) with these modifications. 
For preparing data:
* When preparing the data for training, the location of the  data is set directly with the prepare_data.py file at data_original_path (input) and data_set_path (output) for each of the functions.
* The data_set_path should match the name provided as the training data under train.py (training_path and validation_path).
* The second string argument indicates training/validation/test data division suffix (leave '' if not using suffix). 
* The boolean argument indicates if the training should oversample 
* The last number indicated the number of samples per cube
* The training data is created from the first 3/4 of the cube, and validation data is created from the last 1/4 of the cube
* If 1/4 of the cube is less than the input dim, the validation data uses the last input_dim pixels of the cube

```
python3 prepare_data.py "generate_validation_set" "_test_6" False 25
python3 prepare_data.py "generate_training_set" "_test_6" False 75

```

For training:

* The first string indicates the model name suffix. 
* The combination_number argument indicates the index of the combination of arguments set by variable combo under train.py
* The location of the training data is set directly with the train.py file  (training_path and validation_path) 
* The positive booleans under the argument list under variable combo indicate 1) no oversampling, 2) no rotation, 3) no learn scheduler, and 4) flipping on all three dimensions, and the additional values indicate 5) elastic deformation percentage, 6) rotate deformation percentage, 7) layer settting, 8) learning rate , and 9) training/validation/test data division suffix (leave '' if not using suffix). 

```
python3 train.py "_july23_test" {combination_number}
```
